                <BR></BR>
                Growing into a very respectful lady, she started her basic education from class one at Agorve L/A and was always among the 1st  top 10 scorers. 
                During her school days she was slim and easy going that her mates called her "Kaketor /Agbahodzoe."
                Help was needed so she suspended her schooling to take care of her sibling's children. After a while she returned to school to complete form 4 at the Dornorgbor L/A school.
                
                From there, she continued to Anseco where she studied arts.
                
                She loved to sing and took part in Ep church choir and school drama groups.

                She wrote these 2 entrance exams and passed but she couldn’t go to the training.

                She got admissions into the nursing college twice at the time, but unfortunately, her dream was truncated to caretaking job of her niece nephews and cousins. Thus, sadly her dream of becoming a registered nurse was shuttered in the 1984 and 85.
                
                Hard-working as she was, she moved on to engaged in abolo business alongside petty trading and finally settled for corn business. 
                
                <BR></BR>
                She was skillful and lent sewing as a vocation which she did till her final days on earth.
                She loves gardening, singing, cooking, wearing smiles, and above all caring for all manner of persons. 
                She is loved by all especially her in-laws. Even those who never met her in person has admirations for what ideal woman she had been.
                
                At a point in time, she moved to Accra Mamobi to engage in abolo business where she met her husband whom she later married to and gave birth to her beautiful children.
